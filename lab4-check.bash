# Purpose: Check that students correctly managed user and group accounts
#          when performing this lab, check that students have properly
#          managed services, and created a shell script to work like
#          a Linux command to automate creation of multiple user
#          accounts (user data stored in a text-file).

# Function to indicate OK (in green) if check is true; otherwise, indicate
# WARNING (in red) if check is false and end with false exit status
