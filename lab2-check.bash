# Purpose: Check that students correctly installed centos1, centos2,
#          and centos3 VMs. Check that VMs installed correctly
#          (ext4 filesystem, sizes, SElinux disabled).
#          Check that VMs were backed-up, and backup script created

# Function to indicate OK (in green) if check is true; otherwise, indicate
# WARNING (in red) if check is false and end with false exit status

ATTENTION:

In order to run this shell script, please
have the following information ready:

 - IPADDRESSES for your centos1 and centos2 VMs
   For your centos2 VM, the ifconfig command does
   not work. Instead, use the command:
   ip address

 - Your regular username password for c7host and ALL VMs.
   You were instructed to have the IDENTICAL usernames
   and passwords for ALL of these Linux servers. If not
   login into each VM, switch to root, and use the commands:

   useradd -m [regular username]
   passwd [regular username]

   Before proceeding.  

After reading the above steps, press ENTER to continue
